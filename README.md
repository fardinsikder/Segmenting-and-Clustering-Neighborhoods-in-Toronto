# Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto

This project consists of segmenting and clustering the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. The data about the neighborhoods was obtained from a wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M. The geolocation of the neighborhoods was obtained from this site: http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data. The data about the venues was obtained to the Foursquare API.
